# Hello-World
GitHub Flow Pratice
Hi! I am excited to be here and learn. Thank you in advance for all your help and guidance! 
I am a quick learner but have a bad habit of second guessing myself even if I am sure of my answer. 
So, I may ask the same thing multiple times until I am very confident in myself. 
I am not really sure what to put here about myself but I like watching anime, reading, and spending time with my family in my spare time. I am always looking for things to learn at work and try to be proactive VS reactive. 
I am hoping that I gain enough knowledge with this program to move to a new field at my current job and I intend to put much effort in to this because, as they say, you get what you give!
